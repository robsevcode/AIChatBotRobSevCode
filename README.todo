I want an AI, that has the option to create multiple chats, where I can specify the settings, personality, name, and everything about my character.
Depending on all those attributes, it creates a custom Avatar generated with Stable diffusion. Every 2-3 messages, it generates a new image and sends it as a message,
just to add some atmosphere to the conversation. I can ask for specific images like "show me" using the same character from the chat.
